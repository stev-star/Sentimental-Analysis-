# Getting Started with Sentimental Analysis 

### What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiment in text. Itâ€™s often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers.

### why do Sentiment Analysis? 
Automatically analyzing customer feedback, such as opinions in survey responses and social media conversations.This is often not possible to do manually simply because there is too much data.There are specialized tools which are used and this allows business can gain valuable insights into customer opinions, preferences, and behaviors, which can inform product development, marketing strategies, and customer service efforts. Sentiment analysis can also be used to track brand reputation and monitor public sentiment towards a particular issue or topic.

Steps to take when you want to do Sentiment Analysis :

1. Define the objective and scope of your analysis.
   Defining the objective and scope of your sentiment analysis is an essential first step in the process, as it provides a clear understanding of what you want to achieve and the scope of your analysis. The objective of your analysis should answer the following questions:
   - What is the purpose of your sentiment analysis?
   - What is the specific question you want to answer with your sentiment analysis?
   - What is the target audience for your analysis?
2. Gather and collect the relevant data you want to analyze.
   Collecting data is a crucial step in sentiment analysis, as it provides the foundation for your analysis. By collecting relevant and high-quality data, you can ensure that your sentiment analysis is accurate and provides valuable insights.
3. Preprocess and clean the data
   Preprocessing and cleaning the data is an essential step in sentiment analysis, as it helps ensure that the text data is consistent and standardized, making it easier to analyze. Here are some steps you can take to preprocess and clean the data:
   - Normalize the data: Normalizing the data involves converting all text to lowercase or uppercase, removing special characters
   - Remove irrelevant information: Removing irrelevant information, such as website URLs, usernames, or hashtags
   - Remove punctuation: Removing punctuation marks, such as commas, periods, and quotation marks
   - Remove stop words: Stop words are common words that do not carry any significant meaning, such as "the," "and," or "a." Removing these words can help reduce the size of the text data and make it easier to analyze.
   - Tokenize the data: Tokenizing involves splitting the text data into individual words or phrases, which can then be analyzed and classified according to their sentiment.
4. Choose a sentiment analysis tool that suits your needs and budget.
   
   There are many sentiment analysis tools available, including both open-source and commercial options. Here are a few examples:
   - NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a popular Python library for natural language processing that includes a built-in sentiment analysis tool. The tool uses a lexicon-based approach and is designed to work with movie reviews, but it can be adapted for other text types. NLTK is open-source and free to use.
   - TextBlob: TextBlob is another Python library for natural language processing that includes a sentiment analysis tool. The tool uses a naive Bayes classifier and is trained on a large corpus of movie reviews. TextBlob is open-source and free to use.
   - VADER: The Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is designed specifically for social media text. It is available in the nltk library for Python and is free to use.
5. Train your model (if using a machine learning-based tool).

   In the training process, your model links with a particular input(i.e., text) to the corresponding output based on the test sample. The feature extractor will help to transfer the input to the feature vector. These pairs of feature vectors and the tags provided are transferred to the machine learning algorithm to generate a model.

   In the prediction process, the feature extractor transforms the unidentified text inputs into feature vectors. Further, these feature vectors generate the predicted tags like positive, negative, and neutral. 
6. Analyze the sentiment of the text data, and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.
7. Interpret the results of the sentiment analysis and use them to make data-driven decisions.
8. Refine your sentiment analysis by fine-tuning your model, collecting more data, or adjusting your criteria.
